Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. My name is Ramiro, and I am a student of **DAM (Development of Multiplatform Applications)** and a graduate in **Fine Arts** from the University of Salamanca.

## About Me


My experience in Fine Arts has honed my creativity, critical thinking, and attention to detail. It has enabled me to approach problem-solving from unique perspectives and incorporate innovative design elements into my projects.

I have always been passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity, which led me to pursue studies in both programming and the arts. My studies in DAM are providing me a solid foundation in various programming languages, software development methodologies, and the creation of multiplatform applications.
